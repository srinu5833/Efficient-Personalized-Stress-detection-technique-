Stress Detection from Social Media Articles
New Dataset Benchmark and Analytical Study
This repository provides access to datasets developed for the classification of stress in text-based social media content sourced from Reddit and Twitter. These datasets were introduced in the research paper titled "Stress Detection from Social Media Articles: New Dataset Benchmark and Analytical Study".
 Dataset Overview
We present four high-quality datasets constructed from Reddit posts and tweets. Each entry is labeled with a binary class:
- 0 — Stress Negative
- 1 — Stress Positive
Annotations were generated using a deep neural network (DNN)-based automated strategy, as detailed in the associated study.
Dataset Descriptions
| Dataset Name | Description | 
| Reddit Title | Contains post titles from stress-related and non-stress-related subreddits. | 
| Reddit Combi | Combines post titles and body text into a single sequence from relevant subreddits. | 
| Twitter Full | Includes tweets labeled as stress-related or non-stress-related. | 
| Twitter Non-Advert | A denoised version of the Twitter Full dataset, with promotional content removed. |
